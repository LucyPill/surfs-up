# surfs-up
## Purpose:

The purpose of this challenge is to learn and use SQLite, a version of SQL that lives in the computer, and SQAlchemy, a query tool for SQLite. Finally, we learn and use Flask, a web framewok that uses Python to build web pages. We will use these tools to do weather analysis in the Island of Oahu to determine how the weather could potentially impact the success a new business, a Surf n' Shake Shop. 

## Results:

Looking at the summary statistics, we can see that the minimun temperature in December is 8 degrees lower than the temperature in June; although, the maximun temperature is lower in December as well, it is not by much (maximun temp is June is 85 degrees vs 83 degrees in December).
The average temperature in the Island of Oahu in June is 75 degrees while the average temperature in December is 71 degrees. There is no a big diffrences in the average temperature of June and December. This is a postive indicator to the success of the Surf n' Shake Shop.

## Aditional queries:
Beacuse this is a Surf n' Shake Shop it is very important to determine the amount of rainfall for these two months. Rainy weather is not suitable for this type of business. Knowing that information is very helpful, and can be use as an advantage to come up with an idea to compensate for this type of weather and still make the business profitable during this time.

Looking at the summary stats, we can see that in average for the month of June Oahu gets about 0.14 inches of rain with a max rainfall of 4.43 inches whereas during the month of December the average rainfall is 0.22 inches with a maximun rainfall of 6.42 inches. This is almost twice the average for the month of June and with a Maximun rainfall of 31% more rainfall than the month of June.

## Conclusion:
Overall both months are pretty comparable. Although June is warmer by 4 degrees this is not a drastic temperature change which is good for a Surf n' Shake Shop. There is more rainfall in December but it is not by a lot. The stats suggest that December can be a slow month when compared to June, but still points towards having a successful bisuness.
