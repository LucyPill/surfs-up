# surfs-up
## Purpose:

The purpose of this challenge is to learn and use SQLite, a version of SQL that lives in the computer, and SQAlchemy, a query tool for SQLite. Finally, we learn and use Flask, a web framewok that uses Python to build web pages. We will use these tools to do weather analysis in the Island of Oahu to determine how the weather could potentially impact the success a new business, a Surf n' Shake Shop. 

## Results:

Looking at the summary statistics, we can see that the minimun temperature in December is 8 degrees lower than the temperature in June; although, the maximun temperature is lower in December as well, it is not by much (maximun temp is June is 85 degrees vs 83 degrees in December).
The average temperature in the Island of Oahu in June is 75 degrees while the average temperature in December is 71 degrees. There is no a big diffrences in the average temperature of June and December. This is a postive indicator to the success of the Surf n' Shake Shop.
